# rmbr
A simple program written in Rust for remembering stuff (like a todo-list).

## Installation
rmbr is a single executable that you just download and put somewhere in you path. [Download the latest release here.](https://github.com/amatho/rmbr/releases/latest)

## Why?
Why did I make this? Well, the answer is simple: I just wanted to get more familiar with Rust.
